    "Over the next three weeks. Project 1 will be due Wednesday Nov 23. You will work in teams of 2 on one of the following projects. You can also suggest your own projects pending my approval. Each team will have to do a different project. The goal of each project is for you to write a piece of software that solves a specific programming challenge. ** Once you have chosen a project, I can provide extensive help with both programming and mathematics.**\n",

    "* Topic 2 : (Chebyshev Polynomials) Implement the notions of a fraction (i.e. rational numbers), polynomials (with rational coefficients), Chebyshev polynomials, the Chebyshev inner product for polynomials, and a method for decomposing a polynomials in the Chebyshev basis.\n",
    "\n",
