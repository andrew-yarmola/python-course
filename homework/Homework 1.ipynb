    "# Introduction to Programming Homework 1\n",
    "### Due Wednesday September 28 by 14h00 \n",
    "\n",
    "You will turn in your homework via e-mail [andrew.yarmola@uni.lu](mailto:andrew.yarmoal@uni.lu). For this homework, you will work in IPython. I will provide the instructions for sending me your work down below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download and install Anaconda with Python 3.5 from [continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Download the SciPy Lecture Notes PDF found at [scipy-lectures.org](http://www.scipy-lectures.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "* After installation, open Terminal (Linux, macOS) or Command Prompt (Windows) and launch IPython by typing `ipython` at the prompt and then pressing ENTER.\n",
    "  * Note : at the **end** of your work you will submit your command history using the command `%history -g -f homework_1.py`.\n",
    "* If you have problems or questions, don't hesitate to email me.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1\n",
    "* a. Create a variable called `desc` with the string value `'The sum of 2 plus 2 is equal to'`.\n",
    "* b. Check the type of `desc`.\n",
    "* c. Call the command `print(desc, 2+2)`. Notice that you are giving the `print` function two input variables. In the context of programming, input variables are usually called *arguments*.\n",
    "* d. Create a variable called `print_arg_exp` where you explain in words what `print` would do if you gave it three arguments instead of two. For example, a *wrong* answer would be : `print_arg_exp = 'print would crash if given three arguments'`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Reading \n",
    "Read Sections 1.1 - 2.2.3 inclusive in the SciPy Lecture Notes. Feel free to follow along with their examples and experiment! There are a few things here we did not talk about in lecture, such as strings, dictionaries, and tuples. We will start with these topics next class in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2\n",
    "Write a one line command to output the list of values modulo 373 of the numbers 1 to 999 inclusive. Hint : use list comprehension. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 3\n",
    "Start by creating the lists :\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "days = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]\n",
    "months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May',\n",
    "'June','July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a one line command to output the list of pairs (lists in this case) \n",
    "```python\n",
    "[['January', 31], ['February', 28], ['March', 31],\n",
    "['April', 30], ['May', 31], ['June', 30], ['July', 31],\n",
    "['August', 31], ['September', 30], ['October', 31],\n",
    "['November', 30], ['December', 31]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will learn how to properly *fold* (or intertwine) lists together later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 4\n",
    "Use the `sum()` to approximate $\\pi$ using the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula $$\\pi = \\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty}\\left[ \\frac{1}{16^k} \\left( \\frac{4}{8k + 1} - \\frac{2}{8k + 4} - \\frac{1}{8k + 5} - \\frac{1}{8k + 6} \\right) \\right]$$\n",
    "Use as many summands as you feel appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 5\n",
    "When using list comprehension, you can also filter a list using the `if` keyword. The `if` keyword must be followed by an expression that returns a Boolean value. For example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[ x for x in range(1, 100) if x > 50 and x % 3 == 1 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "For `x in range(1, 100)`, `x` is added to the list if `x > 50 and x % 3 == 1` is `True`. This should remind you of normal set notation $$\\{ x \\mid x \\in \\{1,2,...,99\\}, \\; x > 5, \\text{ and } x = 1 \\text{ mod } 3\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* a. Find all *even* numbers between 1000 and 3000 inclusive which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiples of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "* b. Use python to verify that $$\\{ x \\mid x \\in \\{1,2,...,10000\\}, \\text{ and } x^2 = 2 \\text{ mod } 5\\} = \\emptyset$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Submitting your work\n",
    "* At the IPython prompt, type \n",
    "```python\n",
    "%history -g -f homework_1.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "and hit ENTER. This will record your command history to a file called `homework_1.py`. The characters `-g` and `-f` are called flags. The flag `-g` specifies that we want *all* IPython history and the flag `-f` specifies that the next string is a the name of the file into which the command history will be saved.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* Unless you are familiar with terminal, you may not know exactly *where* IPython saved the file `homework_1.py`. To look this up, type\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "and hit ENTER. This will *print (your) working directory* (pwd for short). You can find your `homework_1.py` file here.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* If you would like, you can use a *basic* text editor such as TextEdit on a Mac or Notepad on Windows to edit your `homework_1.py` file. You can also use `spyder` (included with Anaconda) or get the popular text editor Atom ([atom.io](https://atom.io)). Once you are done editing, email to ([andrew.yarmola@uni.lu](mailto:andrew.yarmoal@uni.lu)).\n",
