First, we check that $x^{n-1} \\equiv 1 \\text{ mod n}$ and then we consider the sequence of numbers $x^d, x^{2d}, \\ldots, x^{d \\cdot 2^{s-1}}$. If $x^{d\\cdot 2^r} \\not\\equiv \\pm 1 \\text{ mod } n$ but $x^{d\\cdot 2^{r+1}} \\equiv 1 \\text{ mod } n$ for some $0 \\leq r \\leq s-1$, then we can conclude that $n$ is composite.\n",
