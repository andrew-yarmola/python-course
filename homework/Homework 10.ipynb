    "## Exercise 1 (Arrays)\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a module called `array_fun.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **a.** Read the end of Lecture 10 starting with the slicing and views section. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** For the rest of this exercise, don't use loops!!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **b.** Learn about the `array.sum()` instance method. Given a square 2-dimensional `numpy` array `M`, we say that `M` is a **stochastic (transition) matrix** if the sum of each **column** of `M` is equal to `1.0`.\n",
    "   * write a function called `is_STM(A)` that checks if a `numpy` array `A` is a 2-dimensional square stochastic transition matrix.\n",
    "   * write a function called `make_STM(A)` which takes a `numpy` array `A` and turns it into a stochastic transition matrix if possible by making each column sum to `1.0`. If `A` is not a square 2-dimensional `numpy` array, raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **c.** Learn about the function `numpy.unique()`. Write a function called `most_frequent(A)` which takes an array `A` and returns (any) most frequent entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **d.** Learn about the function `numpy.bincount()`. Write a **one line** function `array_with_bincount(C)` which takes a 1-dimensional array `C` of integers and returns an array `A` such that `numpy.bincount(A)` is equal to `C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **e.** Write a **one line** function `distance_matrix(points)` which \n",
    "   * takes an array `points` of shape `(k,d)` representing `k` points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$\n",
    "   * returns a matrix `D` such that `D[i,j]` is the Euclidean distance between `points[i]` and `points[j]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **f.** Write a function called `planar_to_polar(points)` which\n",
    "   * takes an array `points` of shape `(k,2)` representing `k` points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ in **Cartesian coordinates**. \n",
    "   * returns an array of shape `(k,2)` representing `k` points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ in **polar coordinates** where the first column is the radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **g.** Write a function called `polar_to_planar(points)` which\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **h.** Use fancy indexing to write a function `swap_cols(A,i,j)` which will take a **2-dimensional array** `A` and swap column `j` with column `i`. You don't need to return anything as you should **modify** the original array `A`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **i.** Define a (nested) structured data type `color_point` where one has a `'position'` given as `('x','y')` and a `'color'` given as `('r','g','b')`. Write a function `random_color_points(num_points)` which generates a random 1-dimensional array of length `num_points` of `color_point`s. For example, you should be able to run\n",

    "For this exercise, you will implement John Conway's Game of Life. See Wikipedia for animations and examples.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.\n",
    "* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n",
    "* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n",
    "* Any empty/dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each cell has at most `8` neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will represent a game grid by a 2-dimensional (integer) array `B` of `1`'s and `0`s with shape `(m, n)`. To make it easier to implement the game, we will assume out board `B` has **walls** of `0`'s around the perimeter. This means that at all stages of the game the top, bottom, right and left edges of `B` are always `0`'s.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note : you can think of this as just playing the game on the middle grid `B[1:-1, 1:-1]`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **a.** Write a function called `neighbor_count(B)` which returns a 2-dimensional array `N` of shape `(m-2, n-2)` such that `N[i,j]` is the number of neighbors of `B[i+1, j+1]`. **Do not use loops !**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **b.** Learn about how binary operators `|` and `&` work for boolean arrays. Use these to write functions :\n",
    "   * `births(N,B)` - returns a boolean array showing births\n",
    "   * `survive(N,B)` - returns a boolean array showing survivors\n",
    "   * `deaths(N,B)` - returns a boolean array showing deaths\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "* **c.** Write a function called `game_of_life(B, num_steps)` which will return a `3`-dimensional array `G` of shape `(num_steps+1, m, n)` such that `G[0,:,:]` is `B` and `G[i+1,:,:]` is the next step in the game after `G[i,:,:]`.\n",
    "\n",
