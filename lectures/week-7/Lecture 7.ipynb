    "* `'a'` open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists\n",

    "* `'t'`\ttext mode (default)\n",
    "* `'+'`\topen a disk file for updating (reading and writing)\n",

    "## Git and GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the goals for this course is to introduce you to the most essential tools of software development. Perhaps the most important such tool is **version control software**. As you work on projects and files, you will often make changes and additions. It is a good idea to not just always have a backup of you work, but to also see what changes others have made. Additionally, if both of you work on at the same time, you might want an automated method for combining your work at the end. For this purpose we will start learning how to use **git**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a simple, fast, and very very popular version control software. I will mostly spend time working with git **from the command line**, however, you can try learning to use the GitHub Desktop software if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note :** Git is the version control software that runs on your computer. GitHub is the cloud service that stores a copy of you code on their servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git manages different versions of your project. It is based around **commits** and **branches**. **Commits** are a frozen version of your code (like a save, but for a whole directory). Git takes over the directory where you are writing your code and manages it in such a way that at any given time the files in the directory represent a **commit** (or an edit to a commit). Commits are organized into **branches**, which are feature paths through your code. Branches usually correspond to feature additions that you work on separately from the stable version of your project. The whole system is called a **repository**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub** is an online (i.e. **remote**) repository storage solution for **git**. In particular, you will have a **local** and a **remote** copy of your repository that you will have to keep in sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running macOS or Linux, you most likely have git already installed and you can just open a command line and try using it. For Windows users, please download git from https://git-scm.com/downloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key words for git are :\n",
    "\n",
    "* `git clone <repo>` : you can make a copy someones existing repository to use, modify, or submit suggested changes.\n",
    "* `git add <file>` : you can add/mark a file as updated so that it will be added next commit\n",
    "* `git status` : ask git to tell you which files have been modified and which have been staged for the next commit.\n",
    "* `git diff <file or omit>` : show the changes since the last commit.\n",
    "* `git commit -m \"Description\"` : commit (i.e. save) all files for which you have called `add`.\n",
    "* `git branch --all` : show all existing branches\n",
    "* `git checkout <branch_name>` : switch the contents of your directory to the latest commit in branch `<branch_name>`.\n",
    "* `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>` : make a new branch copying the current.\n",
    "* `git merge <branch_name_or_commit_id>` : you can `merge` branches together using git's automated tools. Most of the time it will work out for you all the differences and how to combine your code with someone else's code.\n",
    "* `git fetch` : download all new data from GitHub\n",
    "* `git pull` : download **and** merge all new data form GitHub into your local repository\n",
    "* `git push origin <branch_name>` : push your chnages to branch `<branch_name>` to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a little demo and take a look at the GitHub website.\n",

    "### Project 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next three weeks. Project 1 will be due Wednesday Nov 23. You will work in teams of 2 on one of the following projects. You can also suggest your own projects pending my approval. Each team will have to do a different project. The goal of each project is for you to write a piece of software that solves a specific programming challenge. Here are the general topics for each project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Topic 1 : (Homology) Implement the notions of a simplex, simplicial complex, and write a method to compute homology with $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Topic 2 : (Chebyshev Polynomials) Implement the notions of a fraction (i.e. rational numbers), polynomials (with rational coefficients), Chebyshev polynomials, the Chebyshev inner product for polynomials, and a method for decomposing a polynomials in the Chebyshev basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Topic 3 : (Finite Fields) Implement the notions of $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ for $p$ prime, polynomials over $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, and field extension over $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Topic 4 : (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) Implement the notions of an Elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ of $p$ prime, points and arithmetic on an Elliptic curve, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, a simple encryption and decryption algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Topic 5 : (Graphs) Implement the notion of an undirected graph. Create methods to check graph connectedness, find a minimal spanning tree, find a shortest path between two vertices, compute the closure of a graph, and find the graphs strongly connected components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Topic 6 : (Itinerary) Given an itinerary file of flights find the number of days spent in each country.  You will have to look up countries from airport codes. You will generate a CSV spread sheet of the resulting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Topic 7 : (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) Given a probability distribution, implement the Metropolis-Hastings random walk on a square lattice and apply it to computing expectations of a given function. This is called Markov Chain Monte Carlo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please let me know your team and choice of project by Wednesday Nov 9. You will submit your work on GitHub, so please make a GitHub team for this project. Additionally, **each team with have to write a series of tests to check that their code does what it should**."
